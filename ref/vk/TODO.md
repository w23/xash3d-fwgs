## Next

## Upcoming
- [ ] framectl frame tracking, e.g.:
	- [ ] wait for frame fence only really before actually starting to build combuf in R_BeginFrame()
		- why: there should be nothing to synchronize with
		- why: more straightforward dependency tracking
		- why not: waiting on frame fence allows freeing up staging and other temp memory
- [ ] Remove second semaphore from submit, replace it with explicit barriers for e.g. geom buffer
	- [x] why: best practice validation complains about too wide ALL_COMMANDS semaphore
	- why: explicit barriers are more clear, better perf possible too
	- [ ] Do not lose barrier-tracking state between frames
- [ ] Render graph
- [ ] performance profiling and comparison

## 2025-01-23 E387
- [x] (local) waf prefix shenanigans

- [x] track image sync state with the image object itself (and not with vk_resource)

### After stream
- [x] Proper staging-vs-frame tracking, replace tag with something sensitive
	- currently assert fails because there's 1 frame latency, not one.
	- [x] comment for future: full staging might want to wait for previous frame to finish

	- [x] grep for anything else

## 2024-12-10 E383
- [x] Add transfer stage to submit semaphore separating command buffer: fixes sync for rt
- [x] Issue staging commit for a bunch of RT buffers (likely not all of them)
- [x] move destination buffer tracking to outside of staging:
	- [x] vk_geometry
	- [x] vk_light: grid, metadata
	- [x] vk_ray_accel: TLAS geometries
	- [x] vk_ray_model: kusochki
- [x] staging should not be aware of cmdbuf either
	- [x] `R_VkStagingCommit()`: -- removed
	- [x] `R_VkStagingGetCommandBuffer()` -- removed
- [x] Go through all staged buffers and make sure that they are committed
- [x] Commit staging in right places for right buffers
- [x] Add mode staging debug tracking/logs

### After stream
- [x] Fix glitch geometry
	- [x] Which specific models produce it? Use nsight btw

## 2024-05-24 E379

## 2024-04-12 E374
- [x] ~~`-vknort` arg to force-disable RT at init time~~ -- reverted on 2024-04-29

## 2024-03-21 E372: agonizig over agenda
### Player-visible essentials and blockers. Big projects.
- [ ] Light clusters, sampling, and performance -- 90fps HDR on a Steam Deck
- [ ] Transparency, refractions: glass, water, etc
- [ ] Moar and moar correct bounces
- [ ] Denoiser
- [ ] Decals
- [ ] Volumetrics and fog
- [ ] HDR and tonemapping

### Invisible blockers -- foundation/systems stuff
- [ ] Render graph and resource tracking -- track textures, buffers+regions ownership and usage, automatic barriers, etc.
- [ ] Modules and dependencies tracking
- [ ] Integrate rendertests into CI

### Small things
- [ ] Material patching refactoring: do not load any patched textures before they are referenced by the engine itself.
	Only load patched textures for the textures that are in fact used by something.

### Nice-to-have
- [ ] Split Vulkan+RT from xash specifics, start preparing it for being a standalone thing.
	- [ ] clang-format for it

- [-] waters:
     - [-] No water surface visible from underneath -- hidden by enabling culling
     - [-] No coplanar issues visible? -- hidden by culling. Disabling culling makes glitches reappear

## 2023-11-10 E328
- [ ] woditschka
     - [-] potentially collinear planes vs ray tracing #264
         - not super clear how exactly it works, and what it does. And how to cull things
         - leaning towards making our own tesselator, as it might be universally usable for other things, e.g. detail mapping

    - [ ] blue noise texture breaks => make it a separate (3d) thing
    - [ ] index=0 is now valid
        - [x] I. mark 0 as occupied to avoid allocating it
        - [ ] II. Increase all returned indexes by 1. Then dec it back wherever it is passed back
    - (SAD): cannot make builtin textures have stable indexes anymore

# E313
## Pre-next:
- validation crash
## Next:
- KTX2 PR against upstream
- texture leaks
	- better texture storage
		- hash map
	- texture lifetimes/refcounts
	- texture deletion
		- mass (for single device wait idle)

# Programmable render
- [ ] implicit dependency tracking. pass defines:
	- [ ] imports: list of things it needs
	- [ ] exports: list of things it produces. those get created and registered with this pass as a producer
- [ ] resource management refactoring:
	- [ ] register existing resources (tlas, buffers, temp images, ...) in their producers
	- [ ] resource automatic resolution: prducing, barriers, etc
	- [ ] resource destruction
- [ ] ? resource object: name, metadata(type, etc.), producer, status (ready, barriers, etc)

# Multipass + Sampling
- [ ] better simple sampling
	- [x] all triangles
	- [x] area based on triangles
	- [ ] clipping?
	- [ ] can we pack polygon lights better? e.g.:
		- each light is strictly a triangle
		- index is offset into triangles
		- layout:
			- vec4(plane) // is it really needed? is early culling important? can we shove area into there too? e.g plane_n.xy,plane_d, area
			- vec4(v0xyz, e_r)
			- vec4(v1xyz, e_g)
			- vec4(v2xyz, e_b)

# Next
- [ ] remove surface visibility cache
- [ ] rtx: rename point lights to lampochki
- [ ] rtx: rename emissive surface to surface lights
- [ ] rtx: dynamically sized light clusters
	Split into 2 buffers:
		struct LightCluster { uint16 offset, length; }
		uint8_t data[];

# Planned
- [ ] improve nonuniformEXT usage: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples/pull/243/files#diff-262568ff21d7a618c0069d6a4ddf78e715fe5326c71dd2f5cdf8fc8da929bc4eR31
- [ ] rtx: experiment with refraction index and "refraction roughness"
- [ ] emissive beams
- [ ] emissive particles/sprites
- [ ] issue: transparent brushes are too transparent (train ride)
	- [ ] (test_shaders_basic.bsp) shows that for brushes at least there are the following discrepancies with gl renderer:
		- [ ] traditional:
			- [ ] anything textured transparent is slightly darker in ref_vk
			- [ ] "Color" render mode should not sample texture at all and use just color
			- [ ] "Texture" looks mostly correct, but ~2x darker than it should be
			- [ ] "Glow" looks totally incorrect, it should be the same as "Texture" (as in ref_gl)
			- [ ] "Additive" is way too dark in ref_vk
	- [ ] rtx:
			- [ ] "Color" should use solid color instead of texture
			- [ ] "Color", "Texture", ("Glow"?) should be able to reflect and refract, likely not universally though, as they might be used for different intended effects in game. figure this out on case-by-case basis. maybe we could control it based on texture names and such.
			- [ ] "Additive" should just be emissive and not reflective/refractive
- [ ] rtx: filter things to render, e.g.: some sprites are there to fake bloom, we don't need to draw them in rtx mode
- [ ] possibly split vk_render into (a) rendering/pipeline, (b) buffer management/allocation, (c) render state
- [ ] studio models: fix lighting: should have white texture instead of lightmap OR we could write nearest surface lightmap coords to fake light
	- [ ] make it look correct lol
- [ ] studio model types:
	- [x] normal
	- [ ] float
	- [x] chrome
- [ ] rtx: sky light/emissive skybox:
	- [ ] consider baking it into a single (or a few localized) kusok that has one entry in light cluster
	- [x] just ignore sky surfaces and treat not hitting anything as hitting sky. importance-sample by sun direction
	- [ ] pre-compute importance sampling direction by searching for ray-miss directions
- [ ] rtx: importance-sample sky light; there are sky surfaces that we can consider light sources
- [ ] cull water surfaces (see c3a2a)
- [ ] consider doing per-geometry rendermode: brushes can be built only once; late transparency depth sorting for vk render;
- [ ] rtx: too many emissive lights in c3a1b

- [ ] studio models survive NewMap; need to compactify buffers after removing all brushes
- [ ] sometimes it gets very slow (1fps) when ran under lldb (only on stream?)
- [ ] rtx: non-realtime unbiased mode: make "ground truth" screenshots that take 1e5 samples per pixels and seconds to produce. what for: semi-interactive material tuning, comparison w/ denoise, etc.

# Someday
- [ ] more than one lightmap texture. E.g. sponza ends up having 3 lightmaps
- [ ] better 2d renderer: fill DRAWQUAD(texture, color, ...) command into storage buffer instead of 4 vertices
- [ ] brush geometry is not watertight
- [ ] collect render_draw_t w/o submitting them to cmdbuf, then sort by render_mode, trans depth, and other parameters, trying to batch as much stuff as possible; only then submit

## 2022-09-17 E207 Parallel frames
- [x] allocate for N frames:
	- [x] geometries
	- [x] rt models
		- [x] kusochki
		  - [x] same ring buffer alloc as for geometries
		    - [x] extract as a unit
		- [x] tlas geom --//--
	- [-] lights
		- [x] make metadata buffer in lights
		- [-] join lights grid+meta into a single buffer => pipeline loading issues
		- [x] put lights data into a cpu-side vk buffer
		- [-] sync+barrier upload => TOO BIG AND TOO SLOW, need to e.g. track dirty regions, compactify stuff (many clusters are the same), etc
- [x] scratch buffer:
  - should be fine (assuming intra-cmdbuf sync), contents lifetime is single frame only
- [x] accels_buffer:
  - ~~[ ] lifetime: multiple frames; dynamic: some b/tlases get rebuilt every frame~~
  - ~~[ ] opt 1: double buffering~~
  - [x] opt 2: intra-cmdbuf sync (can't write unless previous frame is done)
- [x] uniform_buffer:
  - lifetime: single frame
- [x] tlas_geom_buffer:
  - similar to scratch_buffer
  - BUT: filled on CPU, so it's not properly synchronsized
  - fix: upload using staging?
	- [x] double/ring buffering

- [x] E213:
	- [x] parse binding types
	- [x] remove types from resources FIXME
- [x] E214: ~tentative~
	- [x] integrate sebastian into waf
- [x] E215:
	- [x] serialize binding image format

## 2022-11-26 E216 rake yuri
	- [x] validate meatpipe image formats
	- [x] begin Rake Yuri migration
		- [x] direct lights

## 2023-01-21 E217-E221
- [x] meatpipe resource tracking
	- [x] name -> index mapping
	- [x] create images on meatpipe load
	- [x] automatic resource creation
	- [x] serialize all resources with in/out and formats for images
	- [x] create resources on demand
- [x] parse spirv -> get bindings with names
  - [x] spirv needs to be compiled with -g, otherwise there are no OpName entries. Need a custom strip util that strips the rest?
	- [x] unnamed uniform blocks are uncomfortable to parse.
- [x] passes "export" their bindings as detailed resource descriptions:
  - [x] images: name, r/w, format, resolution (? not found in spv, needs to be externally supplied)
	- [-] buffers: name, r/w, size, type name (?) -- can't really do, too hard for now
- [x] name -> index resolver (hashmap kekw)
- [x] automatic creation of resources
	- [x] images
	- [-] buffers -- no immediate need for that

## 2023-01-22 E222
- [x] refcount meatpipe created images
- [x] rake yuri primary ray

## 2023-01-28 E223
- [x] previous frame resources reference
		- specification:
			- [x] I: prev_ -> resource flag + pair index
			- [ ] II: new section in json
		- internals:
			- [x] I: create a new image for prev_, track its source; swap them each frame
						Result is meh: too much indirection, hard to follow, many things need manual fragile updates.
			- [ ] II: create tightly coupled image pair[2], read from [frame%2] write to [frame%2+1]
			- [ ] III: like (I) but with more general resource management: i.e. resource object for prev_ points to its source

## 2023-01-28-02-08 E224-229
- [x] light_grid_buffer (+ small lights_buffer):
  - lifetime: single frame
  - BUT: populated by CPU, needs sync; can't just ring-buffer it
  - fixes: double-buffering?
    - staging + sync upload? staging needs to be huge or done in chunks. also, cpu needs to wait on staging upload
	- 2x size + wait: won't fit into device-local-host-visible mem
	- decrease size first?
- [x] additive transparency
- [x] bounces
- [x] skybox shadows
- [-] rtx: shrink payload between shaders

- [x] embed shaders into binary
- [x] verify resources lifetime: make sure we don't leak and delete all textures, brushes, models, etc between maps
- [x] custom allocator for vulkan
- [x] rtx: better mip lods: there's a weird math that operates on fov degrees (not radians) that we copypasted from ray tracing gems 2 chapter 7. When the book is available, get through the math and figure this out.
- [x] render skybox
- [x] better flashlight: spotlight instead of dlight point
- [x] rtx: add fps: rasterize into G-buffer, and only then compute lighting with rtx

# Done somewhen
- [x] create water surfaces once in vk_brush
- [x] loading to the same map breaks geometry
- [x] (helps with RTX?) unified rendering (brush/studio models/...), each model is instance, instance data is read from storage buffers, gives info about vertex format, texture bindings, etc; which are read from another set of storage buffers, ..
- [x] waf shader build step -- get from upstream

## Collected on 2024-01-18
- [x] what if new meatpipe has different image format for a creatable image?
- [x] rtx: light styles: need static lights data, not clear how and what to do
- [x] more beams types
- [x] more particle types
- [x] sane texture memory management: do not allocate VKDeviceMemory for every texture
- [x] rtx: transparency layering issue, possible approaches:
	- [x]  trace a special transparent-only ray separately from opaque. This can at least be used to remove black texture areas
- [x] rtx: better memory handling
	- [x] robust tracking of memory hierarchies: global/static, map, frame
	- or just do a generic allocator with compaction?
- [x] rtx: coalesce all these buffers
- [x] rtx: entity lights
- [x] rtx: do not rebuild static studio models (most of them). BLAS building takes most of the frame time (~12ms where ray tracing itself is just 3ms)
- [x] studio models: pre-compute buffer sizes and allocate them at once
- [x] dlight for flashlight seems to be broken
- [x] fix sprite blending; there are commented out functions that we really need (see tunnel before the helicopter in the very beginning)
- [x] fix projection matrix differences w/ gl render
- [x] what is GL_Backend*/GL_RenderFrame ???
- [x] particles
- [x] optimize perf: cmdbuf managements and semaphores, upload to gpu, ...
- [x] rtx: studio models should not pre-transform vertices with modelView matrix
- [x] start building command buffers in beginframe
- [x] cleanup unused stuff in vk_studio.c
- [x] stats
- [-] auto-atlas lots of smol textures: most of model texture are tiny (64x64 or less), can we not rebind them all the time? alt: bindless texture array
- [x] can we also try to coalesce sprite draw calls?
