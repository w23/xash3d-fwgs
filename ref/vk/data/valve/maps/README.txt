Note ("codestyle"):
* Use a monospaced font for editing.
* Don't use tabs for align, only spaces (tabs only for indents, indents not needed in rad files).
* Don't use leading zero to avoid misunderstandings.
* Use UPPERCASE for texture name.
* Use // for commenting.
* Do not add +A~ textures to lights.rad (you have to add them to mapname.rad) unless you are sure it is not an off light bulb.
