Note that this is only for Vulkan/Ray tracing renderer. Prior to submitting anything here make sure that the game does not crash with native GL renderer (`-ref gl`).

**To Reproduce**
1. Map name or attached save file
2. Actions to perform (e.g. go to that room and do this; screenshots appreciated)

**Artifacts**
E.g. attach last few lines of logs (it may be an assert that's informative).

**Moar context:**
 - Commit hash of the build
 - OS
 - GPU vendor and model
 - Driver version
